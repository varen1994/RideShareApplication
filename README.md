# Ride share application 


In this project i have managed to check the ETA between Rider and Requestor as per requirements.

Problem :-
Build an app where you can mark your home and office location (with green markers)and the rideshare requestor can also mark his home and office location(with red markers) on the map. There will be once CHECK button on click of which, you will compute and show a popup telling of you can accept this ride or not(i.e. the whole journey should not take more than extra 1KM.).
If the result is acceptable then show the route on the map.

Also, show the ETAs of both the cases i.e. 
ETA 1. If he does not pick the requestor and go directly to his office.
ETA 2. If he picks up the requestor, drops him and then finally goes to his own office. "

Framework Used :- Apple Mapkit to find route and estimated time travel from one location to another.

Improvements that can be made to this project:-
1. Use Google Framework for getting shortest path between 2 points and calculating ETA with Google api.
